# Two Factor Authentication App
### Front End: Flutter
### Back End: Node.js, Firebase

This application is a simple version of any corporate 2FA app. I've developed this application as a secure and convenient solution to the perpetual problem of users forgetting their passwords and facing login difficulties. The project boasts a versatile and tailored design adaptable to individual needs.

To access their accounts on a website, users are required to enter their email address, simplifying the login process. Additionally, users must have the authentication app installed on their mobile devices, where they sign in with their email and password just once. This step establishes a connection between the user's device and the website, facilitating a seamless authentication process.

Once a user enters their email on the website, a prompt appears on their mobile app, presenting the options "deny" or "approve." In a simple yet effective manner, if the user opts to "deny," website access is restricted, accompanied by a courteous alert. Conversely, selecting "approve" automatically grants the user access to the website, ushering them directly to the homepage. This elegant solution not only enhances security but also simplifies the user experience.

### Versatile UI
The UI design of this project is intentionally kept simple and minimalist, with a focus on user-friendliness and adaptability. I prioritized a clean and straightforward layout, ensuring that it can serve as a foundation for various applications, allowing easy customization to align with specific company branding and needs. Flutter allows consistency in UI design. 

### Web Socket Server
In the context of my app, WebSockets serve as a vital component that accelerates and optimizes real-time communication between users, devices, and our server. By maintaining a persistent connection, my project can instantly update users on crucial information, such as login status changes. This immediate, bidirectional communication streamlines the user experience, ensuring that users receive prompt responses and notifications. It also enhances security and authentication by allowing our server to validate and synchronize user states efficiently, further speeding up our app's overall performance and responsiveness.
